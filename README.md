WeSight is an open-source desktop control console for local AI agents. It helps you install or reuse Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, OpenCode, Qwen Code, DeepSeek-TUI, and the built-in agent runtime, then gives them a visual workspace for chat, tools, files, IM channels, skills, model providers, runtime metrics, and desktop companion workflows.

> Early public releases ship macOS Apple Silicon first. If WeSight helps your agent workflow, a Star makes the project easier for more builders to discover.

## Why WeSight

Terminal-native coding agents are powerful, while their setup, model routing, permissions, IM entry points, file changes, and runtime metrics often live in separate places. WeSight turns those moving pieces into one desktop workspace:

- Install, detect, and reuse local agent CLIs from a beginner-friendly UI.
- Run coding agents through a visual chat with tool panels, slash commands, file diffs, and permission prompts.
- Connect agent tasks to IM channels such as Feishu, with per-engine configuration.
- Track every task with engine, model, token usage, TTFT, TPS, tool latency, steps, status, and duration.
- Extend workflows through SkillHub skills, built-in skills, scheduled tasks, memory, and a desktop pet that follows active work.

## Model Providers

WeSight keeps model setup in one place, then maps it into the selected engine when that engine follows WeSight settings.

- Add multiple providers and models.
- Use official OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini providers.
- Add OpenAI-compatible providers for DeepSeek, Qwen, Moonshot, Ollama, OpenRouter, GitHub Copilot, local gateways, or private endpoints.
- Switch between WeSight-managed model settings and existing local CLI configuration.
- Import or sync local engine configuration when you want WeSight to manage it.

## Download

Public desktop builds are published through GitHub Releases:

- Website: [wesight.ai](https://wesight.ai/)
- Latest release: [github.com/freestylefly/wesight/releases/latest](https://github.com/freestylefly/wesight/releases/latest)

Early public releases currently ship macOS Apple Silicon builds first. Release assets are intended for end users. CI artifacts are short-lived build outputs for maintainers to test before a release is published.

## Download And Install

### 1. Download the DMG

Download `WeSight-*-arm64.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/freestylefly/wesight/releases/latest), open it, and drag `WeSight.app` into the `Applications` folder.

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme/tutorial/install-dmg.svg" alt="WeSight DMG install guide" width="760">
</p>

### 2. If macOS says the app is damaged

Preview builds are not signed and notarized yet. macOS may show a message like:

> “WeSight.app” is damaged and cannot be opened. You should move it to the Trash.

This is usually a Gatekeeper quarantine warning for an unsigned app. It does not mean the downloaded package is corrupted. Click Cancel first.

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme/tutorial/macos-damaged-warning.svg" alt="macOS unsigned app warning" width="620">
</p>

### 3. Remove the quarantine attribute

Open the built-in macOS Terminal app and run:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/WeSight.app
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme/tutorial/xattr-terminal.svg" alt="Run xattr in Terminal" width="760">
</p>

After the command finishes, open WeSight again. If you installed WeSight somewhere else, replace `/Applications/WeSight.app` with the actual path to your `WeSight.app`.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js `>=24 <25`
- npm

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freestylefly/wesight.git
cd wesight
npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

The Vite dev server runs at `http://localhost:5175`.

### Development With Agent Runtimes

```bash
# Start WeSight and detect supported local agent CLIs from Settings
npm run electron:dev

# Convenience aliases currently point to the same development entry
npm run electron:dev:openclaw
npm run electron:dev:hermes
```

Useful OpenClaw development variables:

```bash
# Override OpenClaw source location
OPENCLAW_SRC=/path/to/openclaw npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Force OpenClaw runtime rebuild
OPENCLAW_FORCE_BUILD=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Skip OpenClaw version checkout for local OpenClaw development
OPENCLAW_SKIP_ENSURE=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw
```

## Build

```bash
# TypeScript + Vite
npm run build

# Electron main process
npm run compile:electron

# ESLint
npm run lint
```

## Packaging

```bash
# macOS
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:mac:x64
npm run dist:mac:arm64
npm run dist:mac:universal

# Windows
npm run dist:win

# Linux
npm run dist:linux
```

Managed runtime metadata is declared in `package.json`. Generated runtime folders, build artifacts, local secrets, and packaged release output are ignored by Git.

## Architecture

WeSight uses Electron process isolation. The renderer never directly accesses Node.js APIs; privileged operations go through a typed preload bridge and IPC handlers in the main process.

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme-architecture.svg" alt="WeSight architecture principle diagram" width="960">
</p>

### Main Process

- Window lifecycle, tray behavior, desktop pet windows, and deep links
- SQLite persistence for settings, sessions, messages, runtime calls, skills, and auth tokens
- Agent engine routing and external CLI adapters
- OpenClaw and Hermes gateway lifecycle helpers
- IM gateway integrations and native Feishu routing
- Skill management, scheduled tasks, file activity tracking, and runtime telemetry

### Renderer

- React + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS
- Cowork chat UI, studio view, live workspace, runtime dashboard, and artifacts
- Engine selector, model selector, settings, skills, MCP, agents, IM, memory, and appearance UI
- Stream rendering for messages, tool calls, command output, slash command panels, files, images, and permission prompts

### Key Directories

## Built-in Skills

WeSight includes a broad skills library for day-to-day agent work and connects to SkillHub for marketplace installation.

| Area           | Examples                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Research       | web search, tech news, stock research, film/music search                  |
| Documents      | DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF processing                                          |
| Automation     | Playwright, local tools, scheduled tasks                                  |
| Creative       | Remotion video, frontend design, canvas design, image and video workflows |
| Communication  | IMAP/SMTP email and IM channels                                           |
| Agent building | skill creator, skill vetting, custom planning                             |

Skills can be installed, enabled, disabled, deleted, and routed from the desktop UI.

## Security Model

- Context isolation is enabled.
- Node integration is disabled in the renderer.
- Sensitive operations run through main-process IPC.
- Tool execution can surface permission requests before running.
- Local data is stored in SQLite under the app data directory.
- Runtime folders, build artifacts, generated assets, and local secrets are ignored by Git.

## Roadmap Ideas

- More engine adapters and runtime profiles
- Better local configuration import and provider sync flows
- Richer IM agent profiles and message formats
- Shareable task templates
- More visual inspection tools for long-running agent tasks
- Skill marketplace updates, reviews, and version management
